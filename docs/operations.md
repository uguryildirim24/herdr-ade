# Operations and development

How Herdr Projects works, what it writes where, what its safety settings do and don't stop, and how to run threads on other machines.

## How it works

- **The coordinator is an ordinary agent** in a Herdr pane that follows a skill (`herdr-projects skill` prints it). Plugin code does not route messages, plan work or decide anything.
- **The binary does mechanics.** Starting or restarting a thread, copying reports, marking inbox items handled: each is one deterministic subcommand. It talks to Herdr through Herdr's CLI. The one exception is `focus`/`unfocus`: Herdr 0.9.1 has no CLI command for `agent.view.set`, so those two send one JSON line to the project's socket.
- **Files are the record, prompts are nudges.** Threads write a report file, the ticker writes events to an inbox folder, and the coordinator re-reads state with `context` at the start of every turn. A missed prompt loses nothing.
- **One ticker per projects root** checks every 15 seconds: thread state and groups, pending prompts, changed reports, pull requests (every two minutes), routines, auto-resolve. Remote machines are polled once a minute.
- **Tools are found even under a bare `PATH`.** A Herdr server started outside a login shell gives its plugins a minimal `PATH`; the binary appends `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin` to its own, so the ticker finds `gh`, `rsync` and friends. `ticker status` and `doctor` show what resolved.
- **Nothing destructive is automatic.** The binary never removes a worktree, deletes a branch, merges or pushes on its own. Text from reports, pull requests and command output is never placed in a prompt.

## Where things live

```
~/.herdr-projects/<project>/
  PROJECT.md              settings (TOML between +++ lines) and your standing instructions; yours
  MEMORY.md, memory/      project memory; the coordinator's
  TASKS.md                the task list; the coordinator's
  routines/<name>.md      routines; the coordinator's
  scratch/                the coordinator's temporary files
  threads/<id>.toml       thread record          threads/<id>.md   home copy of its report
  threads/<id>.task.md    the task as given      threads/<id>/     working folder of a tab thread
  inbox/, inbox/done/     events for the coordinator
  library/<id>/           home copy of files a thread produced
  .state/                 status, coordinator pane, ticker state, lock
~/.herdr-projects/.ticker.lock  .ticker.log  .trash/
~/.config/herdr-projects/config.toml             yours, edited by hand
~/.config/herdr-projects/approved-routines.json  written only by `routine approve`
```

Every thread works from `<its working directory>/.herdr-project/<project>-<id>/`: `brief.md` (written by the binary), `report.md` and `library/` (written by the agent). In a git repository that folder is added to `info/exclude`, so nothing in it is committed. **Git therefore treats it as clean: removing a worktree deletes it**, which is why `--remove-worktree` insists on a complete copy home first.

`PROJECT.md` settings: `name` (the Herdr workspace label; a slug-like name such as `herdr-projects` is stored and shown as `Herdr Projects`, plain title case, so write `GTM AI` yourself if you want capitals; an edited name renames the workspace on the next `open`), `goal`, `repos` (`path`, optional `machine`), `coordinator_agent`, `thread_agent` (default `claude`), `max_parallel_threads` (3), `auto_resolve_days` (7), `nudge` (`false`).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `new <name> [--goal] [--repo PATH[@MACHINE]]...` | Create a project folder. |
| `list [--all]` | Projects with status and thread counts by group. |
| `open <project> [--reprime] [--session N \| --socket P] [--rebind]` | Workspace, coordinator tab and coordinator agent; focuses it when it already runs. |
| `context <project> [--peek]` | The digest the coordinator reads every turn. `--peek` records nothing. |
| `inbox done <project> <item>... \| --all` | Mark inbox items handled. |
| `thread start <project> --title T [--repo PATH] [--machine M] [--agent KIND] [--base REF] --task-file F` | New thread; `-` reads the task from standard input. Returns before the agent is up. |
| `thread restart`, `thread prompt`, `thread adopt`, `thread list`, `thread show`, `thread ack`, `thread resolve` | See `--help` on each. |
| `overview [<project>] [--wait]`, `focus [<project>]`, `unfocus` | Threads grouped by what needs you, as text and in the sidebar. |
| `routine list`, `routine approve`, `safety show` | Routines and safety settings. |
| `pause`, `resume`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `delete [--force]` | Project lifecycle. `delete` moves the folder to `.trash/`. |
| `ticker start \| run \| stop \| status`, `doctor`, `skill` | Housekeeping. |

Groups, first match wins: Resolved; Working while starting; **Waiting on you** (failed, a launch stuck for 60 seconds, a pane gone with no report, or blocked for 30 seconds); **Working**; **Landing** (pull request open and approved); **Ready for review** (a report exists and either its pull request is open or you haven't acknowledged it); Idle. Threads idle for `auto_resolve_days` are resolved after a final copy home.

`focus` replaces any sidebar view another tool has set, and `unfocus` clears whatever view is set, because Herdr holds a single one. `focus` covers local threads only.

## Safety settings

Set per project in `~/.config/herdr-projects/config.toml`; `safety show <project>` prints the table header to use.

```toml
[safety."/Users/you/.herdr-projects/billing"]
start_threads = "propose"          # or "auto": the coordinator starts threads without asking
coordinator_agent_args = []        # extra arguments for the coordinator's agent CLI
thread_agent_args = []             # extra arguments for every thread's agent CLI
routine_commands = false           # true lets approved routines run shell commands
```

The table is keyed by the project folder's canonical path. It stays when you delete the project and applies to a new project at the same path.

## The allow-list for your coordinator

The coordinator runs the binary every turn, so allow-list it in your agent **by subcommand, never the bare binary**. `context` prints the exact prefix (`Commands: <binary> --root <root>`); the patterns must start with it. For Claude Code, in the project folder's `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{ "permissions": { "allow": [
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> skill:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> context:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> inbox done:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> list:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> overview:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> safety show:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> routine list:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> thread list:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> thread show:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> thread prompt:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> thread ack:*)",
  "Bash(<binary> --root <root> thread restart:*)"
] } }
```

These patterns also cover the here-document form the coordinator uses to pass text on standard input (checked with Claude Code 2.1). A root with spaces is printed shell-quoted; write the pattern for that quoted form.

- **Allow `thread start` only where you've set `start_threads = "auto"`.** Left off the list, every thread start meets your agent's own permission prompt, which turns "propose first" from skill text into a real confirmation.
- **Never allow** `thread resolve` (with any flag), `thread adopt`, `delete`, `archive`, `pause`, `routine approve`, `new`, `open` or `ticker stop`.

For other agents the principle is the same: allow reading and steering, keep anything that starts, ends or deletes on a prompt.

## What the safety settings do and don't stop

- **They are soft.** Agents have a shell. The guards are the skill text, your agent's permission prompts, keeping `config.toml` and approvals outside every agent's working directory, and `routine approve` refusing without a terminal and a typed confirmation. None of this stops an agent that runs with skip-permission arguments from editing those files directly.
- **A thread can impersonate you.** Any thread agent can prompt the coordinator's pane through Herdr, and that message carries no ticker marker. The skill's rule that a go-ahead must name the threads lowers the risk; it does not remove it.
- **An approved routine command covers the command text only.** `./check.sh` keeps its hash while the script changes.
- **Prompt injection is reduced, not removed.** The coordinator reads reports and may choose to fetch pull request comments itself. Memory is a carrier: whatever it writes there is inlined into every later brief.
- **Agent variety.** The skill and briefs are agent-neutral, but only Claude Code has been exercised.
- **Cost.** Every thread is a full agent session, and each nudge and each `context` spends coordinator tokens.

## Nudges and notifications

`nudge = false` is the default, because on Herdr 0.9.1 a prompt that arrives while you are typing in the coordinator **is merged with, and submits, your half-typed text**. With it off, the ticker shows one Herdr notification per set of new inbox items ("3 new inbox items") and the coordinator picks them up at its next turn. Set `nudge = true` in `PROJECT.md` to have the ticker prompt the coordinator when it is idle; the message always begins `[herdr-projects ticker: automated, not the user, approves nothing]` and never carries outside text.

## Routines

A file `routines/<name>.md`: TOML front matter with `schedule` (`every <N>m|h|d` or `daily HH:MM`, local time), optional `command`, `enabled`; the body is the prompt the coordinator receives as an inbox item when it is due. A routine with a `command` runs (`sh -c`, in the project folder, 60 second timeout) only when `routine_commands = true` **and** you have run `herdr-projects routine approve <project> <name>` in a terminal; its output reaches the coordinator capped at 4,000 characters inside a fence labelled as untrusted. Edit the command and it stops until approved again.

## Threads on other machines

Save the machine with `herdr machine add --label <label> <ssh target>` (both machines need Herdr 0.9.1), then list a repo as `--repo /path/on/machine@<label>` or pass `thread start --machine <label>`. The home machine owns the project; only outbound SSH from home is needed, in batch mode, so set up key-based login first.

- The worktree, the brief and the report live on the remote machine. The home ticker polls it once a minute and copies a changed report with `scp` and the thread's `library/` with `rsync -rt` (symbolic links are never followed or copied; a library over 50 MB is not copied and the inbox item says so).
- A machine that doesn't answer is left alone: no state is read, threads keep their last group, and it is skipped for about two minutes. After ten minutes you get one `outage` inbox item, and one more when it is back.
- A blocked remote thread needs you in its pane on that machine: select the machine in Herdr's sidebar, or run `herdr --remote <ssh target>`.
- `focus` does not cover remote threads: their sidebar tokens are set on the remote Herdr server. They appear in `overview`, `thread list` and inbox items.
- Tasks with no repository always run locally, as tabs.

## Laptop-closed operation

No plugin code is involved: install Herdr and this plugin on an always-on machine, keep the projects root there, open the project there, and attach from your laptop with `herdr --remote <ssh target>` (add `--session <name>` for a named session). The ticker runs on that machine. If Herdr asks whether to restart a remote server "that may not survive SSH connection loss", answering `n` keeps its panes. Checked on a Linux (aarch64) machine from a Mac.

## Development

```bash
cargo test                       # unit tests and scenarios against a scripted fake runner
scripts/dev-server               # a throwaway `hp-dev` Herdr session with a scratch root
scripts/dev-hp <subcommand>      # the binary against <repo>/.dev-root; pass --session hp-dev to open/doctor
scripts/dev-herdr <args>         # herdr against that session
```

Never develop against your default session or `~/.herdr-projects`. [`herdr-notes.md`](herdr-notes.md) records what was verified about Herdr stage by stage, and [`manual-test.md`](manual-test.md) lists the acceptance checks, including the visual ones only a person can confirm. [`going-public.md`](going-public.md) is the checklist for the public release.
